# Next Marketplace (GamesApp)

Your task is to build a simple marketplace app with both list and favourites view. The
implementation should be written in Typescript using React and meet the following
requirements:

- List a collection of items of your choosing
- Allow users to add and remove items to a personal 'favourites list'.
- Provide a view of the user's selected favourite items in the favourites list.

## Things to consider:

- State Management - A structured approach suitable for this type of application is
  required
- Creative Flair - Show off your UX and UI skills
- Testing - Consider testing the most important parts of the application
- Data Fetching - Use a GraphQL API to fetch your data. For data sources, feel free
  to use any GraphQL API available online, or create your own.
- Reduce Complexity - Elegant solutions are generally preferred.
